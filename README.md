# JarekParal

Hi, I'm Jaroslav Páral, but everybody calls me Jarek. There is a list of my projects which I make at school or during my free time.

I study last semester of Master's degree at [Faculty of Informatics Masaryk University](https://www.fi.muni.cz/) with focus on Embedded system. Also, I cooperate with [Robotárna](http://helceletka.cz/robotarna) (Department of Youth Centre Helceletova Brno) where I teach courses, [organize camps](http://robotickytabor.cz) and lead projects in the robotics field.

## My projects

* [[C/C++] NXPCUP-library](https://github.com/JarekParal/NXPCUP-library/) - Library for car's control board on NXPCUP competition based on the Mbed framework.

* [[C/C++] Bachelor's thesis](https://github.com/JarekParal/bcthesis) - LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 in education of programming and robotics - support `C++` library for RTOS system.

* [[C] Network-traffic-analyzer](https://github.com/JarekParal/Network-traffic-analyzer) - Network traffic analyzer of the PCAP file in C.

* [[HW - Eagle] rgb_led_watch](https://github.com/JarekParal/rgb_led_watch) - RGB LED watch base on intelligent LED WS2812.

* [[JavaScript/TypeScript] kentico-onboarding-js](https://github.com/JarekParal/kentico-onboarding-js) - Simple step-by-step task for Kentico Academy to learn basics of js, react, redux.

* [[C#, ASP.NET Web API] kentico-onboarding-cs](https://github.com/JarekParal/kentico-onboarding-cs) - ASP.NET Web application that provide persistence to React application - Kentico Academy onboarding.

* [[HW - Eagle] People-counter-74xx](https://github.com/JarekParal/People-counter-74xx) - Simple board with LED displays, decade counter, BCD to 7-segment decoder and input for sensor (e.g. PIR, laser...).

* [[HW/C] YuniControl - Universal remote control](https://yunicontrol.bitbucket.io/en.html) - The goal of this work is to create universal remote controller which, unlike conventional controllers, can be arbitrarily re-arranged by the user.

## Team projects

Mainly developed on [Robotárna](http://helceletka.cz/robotarna) and [GitHub/RoboticsBrno](https://github.com/RoboticsBrno/).

### [[HW - Eagle/C++] RB3201-RBControl](https://github.com/RoboticsBrno/RB3201-RBControl)

RB3201-RBControl (RBC) is a universal controller board for hobby robots base on EPS32 and development board ESP32-DEVKITC.
Part of the project [Mickoflus](http://www.mickoflus.cz).
Software library [RB3201-RBControl-libary](https://github.com/RoboticsBrno/RB3201-RBControl-library).

My role:

* coordinator of the whole project
* member of a software development

### [[HW - Kicad/C++] ArduinoLearningKitStarter](https://github.com/RoboticsBrno/ArduinoLearningKitStarter)

Learning kit for basic teaching of robotics, electronics and programming which support Arduino Uno/Nano and ESP32-DEVKITC boards.
Software library [ArduinoLearningKitStarter-libary](https://github.com/RoboticsBrno/ArduinoLearningKitStarter-library).

My role: member of hardware and software development

### [[C++] Robot K-ranka](https://github.com/RoboticsBrno/K-ranka)

Robot for competition Ketchup House @ RoboticDay 2017 Prague. The robot was based on LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 and use my RTOS library [EV3rt C++ API](https://roboticsbrno.github.io/RB-ev3rt-hrp2-sdk/ev3rt-doc-cxx-api-en/hierarchy.html) which I made as [bachelor thesis](https://github.com/JarekParal/bcthesis).

My role: software development

### [[C/C++] Robot Aranka](https://github.com/RoboticsBrno/K-ranka)

Aranka is a robot for competition Bear Rescue Advanced @ RoboticDay 2014-2016 Prague. The robot was based on our [control board kvetinac](http://technika.junior.cz/trac/browser/kvetinac_driver_board)) and Raspberry Pi with a camera for detection Bear in-game playground.

We won first place in this competition in the year 2014 and [2015](http://robotickyden.cz/2015/vysledky/) and second place in the year [2016](http://roboticday.org/2016/display/results/contest?contestID=3).

My role: firmware development
